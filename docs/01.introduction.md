# Introduction

## What is Heavy?
Heavy is a framework for easily generating audio plugins for use in interactive sound and music applications such games, instruments or installations.

It aims to reduce the dependency on low-level programming from a creative standpoint and bridge the gap from idea to production-ready implementation.

Heavy makes use of modern software principles to generate highly optimised C/C++ code specifically targeting a wide variety of popular hardware architectures and software frameworks. It can also automatically build plugin binaries for these platforms.

## Supported Patch Formats

Currently Heavy supports compiling Pure Data (.pd) patch files.

However it's important to note that Pd is merely used as a front-end authoring editor, Heavy does not make use of any Pure Data code, and it is entirely unrelated to the embeddable Pd engine, [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd).

## What is Pure Data?
[Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) (Pd) is an open source visual programming environment for real-time time audio and music creation.

Heavy can interpret and convert a subset of features from Pure Data patches.

A full list of all the supported Pd objects can be found [here](/docs/14.Supported_vanilla_objects.md)

## Optimisations
Heavy-generated code comes pre-optimised for architectures that can take advantage of AVX, SSE or NEON instructions. For more bespoke platforms, Heavy also provides a basic implementation supporting single sample block sizes.

## Licensing

In general `hvcc` is free to use, though please be aware of the following licences applied to particular parts of the system.

All the `hvcc` python compiler code is [GPLv3](https://github.com/enzienaudio/hvcc/blob/master/LICENSE).

The files that `hvcc` generates are split into two types:

* [Static](https://github.com/enzienaudio/hvcc/tree/master/generators/ir2c/static): this code is independent of the input patch contents and provides the basic DSP functionality with which generated output can link against. It has a [BSD](https://github.com/enzienaudio/hvcc/blob/master/generators/ir2c/static/HeavyContext.hpp#L2) licence.

* Generated: this relates to all the source files that use information about the input patch, for example `Heavy_{{name}}.cpp`. By default all these files will have a `Copyright (c) 2018 Enzien Audio, Ltd` header, but this can be modified with the [user copyright argument](https://github.com/enzienaudio/hvcc#--copyright-user-copyright).
